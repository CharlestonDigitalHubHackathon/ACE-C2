*Build something world changing!*

## The Project
A power routing map (as a Node.js web application) that visualizes current power plant data and maps the ideal routing between power plants in case of a failure.
  >Can be extended to simulate power plant failures

  >Can be extended to control power plant output routing in case of emergency

  >Can be extended to monitor power plant health and predict failures
